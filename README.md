Hi! Welcome to my website. Below is for my eyes only: 

TODO: 
Look at the tutorial and see what changes I can make: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxziwuuaS3c
Especially where bootstrap but error messages and how this guy makes error messages. 
Also what is Regex? 
Do I even need some of the JS scripts I added at the bottom? 
No emails are being sent. Why? 
Switch smtp from elastic to gmail?? See what changes to make. 

<!-- 1. Update my real CV -->
<!-- 2. Update Resume page according to real CV -->
3. Update Projects page and incorporate Youtube clip of documentary, comedy clips, and work projects too. Maybe new .html page?
4. Contacts page needs to actually work or just have a page that says to send me emails. 
<!-- 5. Make ticker tape clickable. Takes the user to Contact or Projects page.  -->
