README.md

Hi! Welcome to my website. Below is for my eyes only: 

TODO: 
0. Follow this King-Legend-Genius's instructions to link contact form to Google Form to Google Spreadsheet: https://github.com/toperkin/staticFormEmails/blob/master/README.md
01. Add error messages for empty and invalid fields. 
1. Try to follow tutorial step-by-step: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxziwuuaS3c
2. Should I switch SMTP from Elastic to Gmail? 
3. Should all .html files have JS script footers? 
4. Replace Regex stuff.
5. Check EmailJS or Formspree. Try not to use them since they have message limits. But they work for github.io static pages. 
6. Research github.io static pages and SMTP and see if I have to register the "domain" with Elastic or take a completely different course. 
7. Add company logo images to Resume page. 
8. Add "skills used" or bolden skill words on Resume page to make them stand out. 
9. Add video component to Portfolio.
10. Update personal github and make sure it's visible in Resume and Project pages. 
11. Shadow on the project pictures when you hover over them to make them clickable. 
12. Update Projects page and incorporate Youtube clip of documentary, comedy clips, and work projects too. Maybe new .html page?
13. Contacts page needs to actually work or just have a page that says to send me emails.
